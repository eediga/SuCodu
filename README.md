# SuCodu

SuCodu is a Web Application developed for the technical competition held at Cummins College of Engineering, Pune which is a combination of solving "sudoku + MCQs". 

Once a participant successfully login into the system he/she can see the screen divided into 2 parts:
1. Sudoku grid
2. 20 programming MCQs
If a participant gives the correct answer to an MCQ then a number in the sudoku gets filled automatically. For every correct answer to MCQ the linked blank space in Sudoku will be filled with an associated number. After solving all the MCQ's remaining numbers in the sudoku should be filled by a participant to complete sudoku. More the MCQs are correct more hints the participant gets and sudoku can be solved easily. Hence the chances of winning increase.
If a participant tries to solve sudoku without solving MCQs it will be very difficult to solve and the chances of winning decrease.
